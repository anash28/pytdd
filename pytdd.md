Lulz, Harry references Zed Shaw (p.21)
> Step back and think and have a think about what we're trying to achieve at this
point in the book.
> I'll reckon you'll learn more about TDD from these stop and think moments than
you do from all of the bits where the following instructions and copy-pasting
goes smoothly.
> Or it may be a real bug. Be tenacious, read the error message carefully (see my
aside on reading tracebacks a little later on in the chapter), and you'll
get to the bottom of it. It's probably just missing a comma, or trailing-slash,
or maybe a missing "s" in once of the Selemium find methods.
> But, as ```python Zed Shaw ``` put it so well, this kind of debugging is also
an absolute vital part of learning, so do stick it out!
